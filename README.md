# Distribute
## an experiment in using the smart contract-enabled token economies to decentralize the governance, maintenance, and financial support of public utilities, communal infrastructure, and common pool resources.

The desired outcome of Distribute is a multifaceted incentive structure that makes sure that:

1. collective public infrastructure projects receive sufficient funding from capital holders;
2. governance of the public utility is totally transparent;
3. direct decision making power in the public utility is decoupled from financial investment;
4. the infrastructure itself is created, maintained, and operated by those who directly benefit from it;
5. multiple utilities may interlock in the future to create a synergistic system of many distributed utilities and communal infrastructure projects.
